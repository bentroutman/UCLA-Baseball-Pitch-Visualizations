# 3D Pitch Trajectory Visualizations (UCLA Baseball)
This project visualizes pitch trajectories in 3D using R, Plotly, and an interactive Shiny interface. It was developed as part of UCLA's Bruin Sports Analytics club to compare pitch characteristics and understand tunneling or pitch type cues.

The tool animates multiple pitches in sequence and differentiates pitch type by color to give a complete assessment of a pitcher's arsenal. It could easily be modified to include multiple pitchers (for the sake of comparison) or multiple of the same pitch type (to show variance).

## Features
- Uses TrackMan data to visualize a specified pitcher's entire arsenal.
- Animates pitch flight paths using 3D coordinates.
- Shows release and end points of pitches, differentiated by color.
- Easy to filter by pitch type, game, pitcher, velocity range, etc.
- View trajectories individually or in sequence.
- Includes a sample dataset for demonstration.
